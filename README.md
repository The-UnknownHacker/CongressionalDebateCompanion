## Author Introduction
Hey! I'm Aaradhya Panda (pizzalover125), and I built this application. Personally, I love coding and Congressional Debate. I've placed in several tournaments, my best performance being the Middle School Arizona Winter Cup @ BASIS Peoria, where I placed 5th in Congressional Debate. I'm building this app with features that I would personally use in my competitions.
