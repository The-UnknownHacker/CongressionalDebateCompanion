## About the Author
Hello! I'm Aaradhya Panda (pizzalover125), the creator of this app. I have a passion for coding and Congressional Debate. I've competed in several tournaments, with my best performance being 5th place at the Middle School Arizona Winter Cup @ BASIS Peoria. I designed this app with features that I personally find useful in competitions.

## Features Overview
Here's a summary of each feature and how it can assist Congressional Debate competitors.

### Home
This is a standard home page with basic navigation.

### Resources
Starting something new? Good mentorship is key. I've curated excellent guides to help you on your Congressional Debate journey.

### Timer
In Congressional Debate, speeches are timed at 3 minutes and 10 seconds. Practicing your timing is crucial for success. This app includes a timer page designed specifically for Congressional Debate. It simulates the gavel taps used in competitions: once at 2:00, twice at 2:30, and three times at 3:00. The app beeps and vibrates accordingly and tracks your speech times in local storage.

### Dictionary
The legal field is full of technical jargon. This simple, bloat-free dictionary lets you enter a word and get its definition, utilizing the Dictionary API.

### Tournaments
To win, you need to compete. This page lists upcoming tournaments in your area with a minimalist layout. Click on a tournament for more details, which are fetched using the Tabroom API.

### Notes
During legislative sessions, taking notes on other participants' speeches is essential. This allows you to effectively counter their arguments in your own speeches, which can impress the judges. This feature saves all your notes in local storage, ensuring they are not lost.
